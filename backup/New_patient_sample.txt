A 45-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented to the hospital due to an acute exacerbation. The patient has a 15-year history of smoking (20 cigarettes per day), although she quit smoking 5 years ago. She has long-standing respiratory issues, including progressive dyspnea and reduced exercise tolerance. Upon admission, she complained of worsening dyspnea, persistent cough, increased sputum production, and low-grade fever (38.1°C). Her respiratory symptoms had progressively worsened over the past 3 days, and she had difficulty performing daily activities. Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely triggered by a viral respiratory infection. Blood gas analysis showed a mild hypoxemia (PaO2 60 mmHg), and chest X-ray revealed signs of increased bronchial markings and hyperinflation, consistent with COPD exacerbation. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation levels above 90%.

A 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. The patient described the onset of pain as sudden, severe, and substernal, radiating to his left arm and jaw, and associated with shortness of breath and nausea. He denied any recent physical exertion or stressors prior to the onset of pain. He has been managing his hypertension with medication and his diabetes with oral hypoglycemics, but his blood pressure has been poorly controlled over the past few months, and his most recent HbA1c was 9.2%. The patient has a family history of cardiovascular disease, with his father having died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. The patient’s smoking history includes 30 pack-years, although he quit smoking 10 years ago. He also reports occasional alcohol use, approximately 2-3 times per week.
